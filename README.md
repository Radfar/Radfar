## 🔹 About Me
I am an accomplished Industrial Automation and Electronics Engineer with extensive experience in both academia and industry, specializing in industrial control systems, PLC programming, SCADA/BAS platforms, VFDs, and industrial networks. I combine a research-driven mindset with hands-on experience to deliver innovative, reliable, and scalable automation solutions.
Currently based in GTA, Canada, I am seeking opportunities to contribute my expertise in industrial and building automation, control systems, and IT/OT-integrated solutions to organizations looking to modernize and optimize operations.
I have designed, commissioned, and maintained electrical and electronic systems for complex manufacturing lines and building automation applications. My work includes IT/OT integration using SCADA and BAS platforms, bridging operational technology with IT systems through OPC-UA, MQTT, cloud tools, and databases, and supporting both manufacturing and smart building operations with industrial networks such as BACnet, Profinet, and Ethernet/IP.
In addition, I have a strong background in electronic hardware design, firmware development, PCB and prototype design using Altium, and hands-on experience with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, and various microcontrollers, enabling me to develop innovative embedded solutions alongside automation systems.
Throughout my career, I have collaborated with mechanical engineers, software developers, and project managers to deliver high-performance automation systems. I have also led and mentored teams of technicians, programmers, and engineers, ensuring projects are executed safely, efficiently, and to design standards.
As a former university faculty member, I bring academic insight combined with industry expertise, allowing me to approach automation challenges analytically while delivering practical, real-world solutions. I am passionate about leveraging modern automation technologies, smart systems, and IT/OT convergence to improve operational efficiency, reliability, and digital integration.
